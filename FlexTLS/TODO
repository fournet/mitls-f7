  - Nothing special to do at the FlexTLS library level?

- Infer secret values when not set
  - Each function that requires a secret value to operate should try to generate it on the fly if the secret is not set.
    E.g.: makeVerifyData should use pms_to_ms if ms is not set
          ms_to_keys should use pms_to_ms if ms is not set
          installing record keys should use ms_to_keys if keys are not set
    If we design this properly, an automatic cascade should happen when several secrets are not set. However,
    I'm afraid this may require each function to take a lot of extra parameters, just for the case in which secrets
    are not set. So here we have to check the trade-off between nice interface and clever functionality.
